Use keys 1,2 to switch scenes. There is a delay (but I'm sure you already know this)

I did not finish either of the bonuses, but I did attempt the refraction bonus. So there is refraction code but it does not 
contribute anything to the final image. The reason I kept it is because the compiler will optimize it out and since the deadline was
extended I may revisit for a second attempt and would be nice to have my old code around.
